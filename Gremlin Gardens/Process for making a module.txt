1. Add a PathCreator and Track Module component.
2. Move the curves to match your geometry.
3. Fiddle with TrackModule. Make sure that whatever animation you're playing
matches with the base speed of your TrackModule (The TrackManager will speed or slow 
both the Gremlin's speed and animations based on their skill).
